# Interface in JS?

Figure out if interface/type can be used in JS projects. If not, how do we enforce mandatory props and how do we convey to developers which props are optional?

## Interfaces and Types in JavaScript Projects

In JavaScript, the concepts of interfaces and types are not natively available like they are in statically typed languages such as TypeScript. However, JavaScript does provide alternatives and patterns to achieve similar functionality.

### Enforcing Mandatory Props

To enforce mandatory props in JavaScript projects, we can follow these approaches:

1. **Documentation**: Clearly document the required props for each component or module. Developers can refer to the documentation to understand which props are mandatory and need to be provided when using the component or module.

2. **Runtime Checks**: Implement runtime checks within the component or module code to verify the presence of mandatory props. This can be done using conditional statements or assertions to ensure that the required props are provided before proceeding with the execution.

3. **Default Values**: Set default values for props that are not provided. This can help handle cases where certain props are not mandatory but still need to have a valid value. By providing appropriate default values, we can ensure that the component or module functions as expected even if the props are not explicitly provided.

### Conveying Optional Props

When it comes to conveying optional props in JavaScript projects, we can adopt the following strategies:

1. **Documentation**: Clearly document which props are optional and provide information about their purpose and behavior. This helps developers understand the available options and decide whether they need to provide those props based on their specific requirements.

2. **Default Values**: Similar to enforcing mandatory props, we can define default values for optional props. This allows developers to omit those props if they are satisfied with the default behavior.

3. **Type Annotations**: Although JavaScript itself doesn't have built-in type systems like interfaces or types, if we are using a type-checking tool like TypeScript, we can leverage type annotations to explicitly define the optional props. TypeScript provides syntax for specifying optional properties using the `?` symbol after the prop name.
