# Interface in JS?

Figure out if interface/type can be used in JS projects. If not, how do we enforce mandatory props and how do we convey to developers which props are optional?

## Interfaces and Types in JavaScript Projects

In JavaScript, the concepts of interfaces and types are not natively available like they are in statically typed languages such as TypeScript. However, JavaScript does provide alternatives and patterns to achieve similar functionality.

### Enforcing Mandatory Props

To enforce mandatory props in JavaScript projects, we can follow these approaches:

1. **Documentation**: Clearly document the required props for each component or module.

2. **Runtime Checks**: Implement runtime checks within the component or module code to verify the presence of mandatory props.

3. **Default Values**: Set default values for props that are not provided.
